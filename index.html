                I wanted to build a page that I can use as a tinkering space and for future reference that demonstrates different concepts and utilizes a wide variety of tags and styles and let's me practice using these methods. This reminded me of needlework samplers.

                    The earliest sampler [pictured left]...is a spot sampler...of the Nazca culture in Peru formerly in the Museum of Primitive Art, New York City. It is estimated to date from ca. 200 BCEâ€“300 CE.

                    The oldest surviving European samplers were made in the 16th and 17th centuries. As there were few pre-printed patterns available for needleworkers, a stitched model was needed. Whenever a needlewoman saw a new and interesting example of a stitching pattern, she would quickly sew a small sample of it onto a piece of cloth - her 'sampler'. The patterns were sewn randomly onto the fabric as a reference for future use, and the woman would collect extra stitches and patterns throughout her lifetime.

                    Samplers were mainly school exercises during the 18th and 19th centuries, and were almost entirely worked in cross stitch... These samplers were stitched more to demonstrate knowledge than to preserve skill...and girls were taught the art from a young age.

                So it is in the spirit of the samplers of 200-300 years ago that I start this task, a beginner's sampler for the 21st century. But perhaps, with practice and experience, this may turn into a tech-version of the samplers from 500 years ago, a place to save more advanced techniques for future reference.

                    I am still getting the hang of <code>&#60;span&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> tags. At first, the <code>&#60;span&#62;</code> tag <em>really</em> confused me as it wasn't immediately evident what it does. Then, after the introduction to CSS, things became <em>much clearer</em>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still figuring out when it is best to use <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> tags and how they differ from <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> tags.
